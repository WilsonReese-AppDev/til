In class today we spent some time working on Excerism.io.
However, I was having a lot of trouble even figuring out why my tests failing. In the irb terminal I my code seemed to be working.
So, I Google some solutions to it to see if I could be inspired. I found some solutions that were similar (though much more elegant). This one in particular was one that I liked: https://exercism.io/tracks/ruby/exercises/acronym/solutions/6df90b2f817b409fa47b35022bd8a873
However, when I straight up copy-pasted their code into Gitpod, I still had no luck getting the tests to work. 
This leads me to believe I have done something wrong in setting things up. However, the others were also having problems.
I'm going to try with a different exercise and see if I have any luck. 

But I have other homework, so it will have to be tomorrow or Saturday.
