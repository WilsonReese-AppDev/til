- In class today we spent some time working on Excerism.io.
- However, I was having a lot of trouble even figuring out why my tests failing. In the irb terminal I my code seemed to be working.<br>
- So, I Google some solutions to it to see if I could be inspired. I found some solutions that were similar (though much more elegant). This one in particular was one that I liked: https://exercism.io/tracks/ruby/exercises/acronym/solutions/6df90b2f817b409fa47b35022bd8a873
- However, when I straight up copy-pasted their code into Gitpod, I still had no luck getting the tests to work. <br>
- This leads me to believe I have done something wrong in setting things up. Also, the others were also having problems, and we had pretty similar code.<br>
- I'm going to try with a different exercise and see if I have any luck. 

But I have other homework, so it will have to be tomorrow or Saturday.

- I did not have auto save on. When I turned it on it started working when it hadn't before.
- As for git commits, I think I understand. 
- As for testing, I tried another one and I think my method should have worked. But I don't know how to write the code in such a way that it passes the test.
- There is Phrase.new("word") but Phrase is an unitialized constant. Maybe I can figure it out, but I am not confident. Maybe since I have a feel for the code, I'll just get used to the specifcs of testing as we go through the course. I am tired, so I am done for now.
