In the exercism assignment I learned a couple things that seemed practically useful.
1) If I am writing a method that needs to be called directly on the class, the method needs to have self.method_name. Otherwise, the method is not calling on anything. I am not exactly sure the disctinction but it is something to pay attention to.
2) .strip is a handy little guy
- It removes the whitespace at the beginning and end of a string (maybe more?). This is helpful for making sure stuff is formatted correctly and ignore erroneous spaces.
3) Using .map instead of .each
- I have been using .each to do something to each element in an array or hash.
- I have also been using .each to look at each element in an array or hash and check if it meets some condition.
- Using this has a catch all method has made my code a little messy.
- Moving forward, I need to figure it out if I am 
-- changing all the elements  => use .map
-or 
--simply trying to check a condition => use the appropriate method for a hash or array
